            <div class="panel">
                <p>Yes, because there are many websites on the internet that upload viruses and malware in the name of movies or series, and then when the user downloads it, the user's mobile and PC get hacked. Considering this aspect, Flixlove first checks the files and then makes them downloadable.</p>
